📋 Strategic Overview

Primary Objectives

1. Mobile-First Development: Complete ML lifecycle from Android device
2. Ultra-Lightweight Architecture: Models optimized for mobile constraints
3. Multi-Cloud Native: Deploy anywhere without vendor lock-in
4. Cost-Optimized: Maximize free tiers, minimize operational costs

Guiding Principles

· Explicit over implicit: Clear deployment paths for each platform
· Simple over complex: Minimal dependencies, maximum functionality
· Flat over nested: Straightforward project structure
· Readability counts: Self-documenting architecture decisions
