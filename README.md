# Lightweight ML Deployment: Termux to Multi-Cloud

> "Beautiful is better than ugly. Simple is better than complex."

Build lightweight machine learning models entirely from Android Termux and deploy seamlessly across multiple cloud platforms.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

- **Mobile-First**: Complete ML lifecycle from Android device
- **Ultra-Lightweight**: Models optimized for mobile constraints
- **Multi-Cloud Native**: Deploy anywhere without vendor lock-in
- **Cost-Optimized**: Maximize free tiers, minimize operational costs
